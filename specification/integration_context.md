# Integration Context

**Status**: [Experimental](../README.md#versioning-and-status-of-the-specification)

In order to create a more complete picture of a distributed environment, we
propose the use of additional headers to pass extra context details between
Cisco observability components. Specifically, we are concerned with passing
pieces of OpenTelemetry resource information and AppDynamics app
structure and business transactions. This additional data is intended to
augment any existing trace context, and will be carried in requests between
splunk-otel and AppDynamics agents.

# Headers

The following defines several new headers and describes their intended use.
All headers MUST be treated as optional -- peer services will not always
generate them. These headers SHOULD be treated as opaque values of type
string.

* `cisco-ctx-acct-id` - Contains the ID of the AppDynamics account.
* `cisco-ctx-app-id` - Contains the ID of the AppDynamics application.
* `cisco-ctx-tier-id` - Contains the ID of the AppDynamics tier.
* `cisco-ctx-bt-id` - Contains the ID of the AppDynamics business transaction (BT).
* `cisco-ctx-env` - Contains
  the [deployment.environment.name](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/deployment/)
  resource value from an OpenTelemetry based component.
* `cisco-ctx-service` - Contains the [service.name](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service)
  resource value from an OpenTelemetry based component.

## Splunk OpenTelemetry distributions

This section applies to Splunk distributions of OpenTelemetry instrumentation
components. In brief, Splunk OTel distributions will need to understand when
spans are being created as part of an AppDynamics "Business Transaction" (BT),
and will add span attributes to clarify the AppDynamics invocation context.

### Configuration

Splunk OTel distributions MUST provide a way for users to opt-into the
consumption and propagation of additional Cisco (bespoke) integration context.

The configuration SHOULD be named `cisco.ctx.enabled` or an idiomatic
equivalent for each language. If using environment variables, the
configuration SHOULD be named `CISCO_CTX_ENABLED`. The default value
MUST be `false` or equivalent language-specific non-truthy value.

**User note**: If you opt into using this feature, the name of your
deployment environment and service will be exposed externally
in headers. If you have made a terrible mistake by putting sensitive or
secret information in these fields, you should not use this feature.

## Incoming State

When `cisco.ctx.enabled` configuration is `true`, Splunk implementations MUST
extract fields from the `cisco-ctx-*` headers (above) and add extra
attributes to the first Span created as part of the incoming request context.
Null or missing values MUST be handled gracefully by simply
omitting the span attributes.

| header              | span attribute             | description                                                             | example                           |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `cisco-ctx-acct-id` | `appd.upstream.account.id` | The AppDynamics account ID of the upstream component making the request | 65230, 10018b                     |
| `cisco-ctx-app-id`  | `appd.upstream.app.id`     | The ID of the AppDynamics instrumented application.                     | 0293845, destination-factory-9000 |
| `cisco-ctx-bt-id`   | `appd.upstream.bt.id`      | The ID of the upstream AppDynamics business transaction (BT)            | 209834098273                      |
| `cisco-ctx-tier-id` | `appd.upstream.tier.id`    | The "tier id" to which the AppDynamics instrumented application belongs | 12, xdev.tier9                    |

Note: the `upstream` prefix is intentional here. It indicates that the value
is being copied from an upstream source and helps to differentiate from the
same IDs that could originate in a simultaneous AppDynamics instrumentation.

## Outgoing State

When `cisco.ctx.enabled` is `true`, Splunk implementations MUST
generate extra headers that contain certain values obtained from the
OTel Resource:

| resource attribute            | outbound header     | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | example             |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `deployment.environment.name` | `cisco-ctx-env`     | The name of the OpenTelemetry deployment environment ([spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/4f77620fe731c10d40f7d50c543d4e5c73a46ebf/docs/attributes-registry/deployment.md#deployment-environment-name)) | production, staging |
| `service.name`                | `cisco-ctx-service` | The name of the OpenTelemetry service ([spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/4f77620fe731c10d40f7d50c543d4e5c73a46ebf/docs/attributes-registry/service.md#service-name))                                  | checkout, cart      |

All other resource attributes SHOULD be ignored and not placed into
any headers, unless required elsewhere.
