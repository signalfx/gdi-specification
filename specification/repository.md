approval is granted, GDI repositories MUST NOT cut a GA release.

  - The `CHANGELOG.md` is intended to be consumed by humans, and not machines.
  - The file SHOULD contain an `Unreleased` section at the top, which includes
    changes that have not yet been released.
  - The file MUST be in reverse chronological order, with the most recent
    releases at the top of the file, after the `Unreleased` section.
  - Each release SHOULD be separated by a line separator (`---`) from the other relases.

    area (if applicable).
  The following sub-sections MAY be used, as appropriate or specified.
    - `General` - General comments about the release that users should know about.
    - `Breaking Changes` - Any changes that will break backward compatibility
      with previous versions. MUST list all breaking changes.
    - `Bugfixes` - Details of bugs that were fixed. SHOULD list all bug fixes.
    - `Enhancements` - New features that have been added to the repository. SHOULD
      list all new features.
  - The CHANGELOG.md SHOULD NOT list every PR, but only changes significant
    from an end-user point of view. Anyone who is interested in all the details
    of every change in the repository can use the git log for that.

  > The release process involves signing built packages and binaries and thus
  > must be kept private and not exposed publicly.
- MUST add the [SECURITY.md](templates/SECURITY.md)
  - SHOULD add dependabot information to `SECURITY.md` if applicable
- SHOULD NOT contain comprehensive application examples. Application examples
  showing multi-system interactions or even cross-language use cases SHOULD be
