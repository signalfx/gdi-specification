# Repository

Every GDI project repository MUST adhere to the following specification before
it can release a GA (`1.0.0`) release. GDI projects MUST submit a GitHub issue
on the GDI specification using the `Project GA approval` type. Until the
approval is granted, GDI projects MUST NOT cut a GA release.

- MUST have a [CHANGELOG.md](templates/CHANGELOG.md) updated for every release
  - The CHANGELOG.md is intended to be consumed by humans, and not machines.
  - The file SHOULD contain an `Unreleased` section at the top, which includes changes that

    - `Bugfixes` - Details of bugs that were fixed.
    - `Enhancements` - New features that have been added to the project.
