#### Bug fixes

- Properly use the terms "component" and "GDI repository".

### Configuration

#### Enhancements

### Repository

- Update template CODEOWNERS file to include the Splunk documentation team.
- Add repository LICENSE template.
- Clarify maintainer and approver teams can be shared across repositories.

### Configuration

- Add support for the `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable.
- Remove suggestion for end users of instrumentation libraries to provide
  configuration.
- Add RUM libraries configuration specification.
- Set the default value for `OTEL_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE_LENGTH_LIMIT` to `12000`,
  instead of the default OpenTelemetry of unlimited.
- Require repositories to link to official Splunk docs in `README.md`.
- Add Serverless libraries configuration specification.

### Profiling

- Initial, experimental, specification for profiling libraries added.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-06-01

### General

- First stable release of the GDI specification. This release includes stable
  requirements and recommendations for GDI repository composition and
  versioning and Splunk distributions of OpenTelemetry configuration.
